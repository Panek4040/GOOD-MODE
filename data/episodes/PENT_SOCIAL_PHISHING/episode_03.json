Attack succeeded due to: extensive OSINT enabling realistic pretext, relationship building establishing trust, perfect timing (CEO unavailable), voice cloning adding verification layer, exploiting human psychology (urgency, authority, confidentiality). Zero technical controls prevented attack. Implemented remediation: mandatory dual approval for wires >$100K, verbal verification using pre-established code words, wire transfer callback to known numbers only, executive impersonation awareness training, email authentication (DMARC reject), regular BEC simulations. Subsequent tests showed 100% detection rate.",
