  "description": "Sophisticated multi-channel attack combining smishing, vishing, and email phishing to compromise financial institution customer accounts and demonstrate defense gaps.",
  "difficulty": "advanced",
  "scenario": "Red team engagement for regional bank testing customer security controls and fraud detection. Goal: demonstrate how attackers combine multiple channels (SMS, voice, email) to bypass single-channel defenses and harvest customer banking credentials.",
  "steps": [
    {"step_number": 1, "tool": "osint_pretexting_recon", "action": "Research bank's customer service procedures and phone numbers", "parameters": {"target": "RegionalBank"}, "expected_result": "Identified official customer service numbers, common procedures, security question patterns, employee naming conventions", "explanation": "Realistic pretext requires knowledge of actual bank procedures"},
    {"step_number": 2, "tool": "sms_phishing_smishing", "action": "Send SMS alerts about suspicious account activity", "parameters": {"message": "ALERT: Unusual activity on your account. Verify immediately or account will be locked."}, "expected_result": "250 SMS messages delivered to customer phone numbers, 35% click rate on verification link", "explanation": "SMS creates urgency and primes victims for follow-up"},
    {"step_number": 3, "tool": "credential_harvester_pages", "action": "Deploy fake bank login page", "parameters": {"target_site": "https://onlinebanking.regionalbank.com"}, "expected_result": "Exact clone deployed at https://secure-verify-regionalbank.com with valid SSL, captures username/password/security questions", "explanation": "Victims from SMS directed to credential harvester"},
    {"step_number": 4, "tool": "vishing_voice_phishing", "action": "Follow up with automated voice calls", "parameters": {"caller_id": "+1-800-BANK-HELP"}, "expected_result": "Robocall to 250 customers, 120 answered, 45 pressed 1 to speak with 'fraud department', 18 provided full account details to live operator", "explanation": "Voice adds legitimacy and urgency, increases compliance"},
    {"step_number": 5, "tool": "email_spoofing_smtp", "action": "Send confirmation emails after voice calls", "parameters": {"from": "fraud@regionalbank.com"}, "expected_result": "Email confirmation sent to 18 vishing victims, 12 clicked email link, 8 re-entered credentials on landing page", "explanation": "Multi-touchpoint attack increases credibility and success rate"},
    {"step_number": 6, "tool": "credential_harvester_pages", "action": "Analyze harvested data", "parameters": {}, "expected_result": "Total compromised: 87 accounts (SMS: 52, Vishing: 18, Email: 17), including full credentials, security questions, account numbers, recent transaction history", "explanation": "Multi-channel approach yields significantly higher success than single vector"},
    {"step_number": 7, "tool": "set_social_engineering_toolkit", "action": "Document attack chain and generate remediation report", "parameters": {}, "expected_result": "Comprehensive report showing 34.8% overall success rate (87/250), attack timeline, customer demographics of victims, recommendations for SMS authentication warnings, voice verification procedures, email DMARC", "explanation": "Detailed analysis drives security improvements"}
  ],
  "outcome": "Multi-vector attack successfully compromised 87 of 250 targeted accounts (34.8% success rate). Attack chain combining SMS → Voice → Email proved highly effective, with each channel reinforcing others. Zero fraud alerts triggered during campaign. Bank implemented: SMS security warnings on all messages, enhanced voice authentication procedures, DMARC email policy, customer education program, fraud detection ML improvements, channel correlation monitoring. Follow-up test 6 months later showed 75% reduction in successful compromises.",
