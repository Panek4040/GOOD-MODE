  "outcome": "Successfully demonstrated sophisticated WiFi attack chain combining evil twin AP, deauthentication, handshake capture, and traffic interception. Captured credentials from 12 devices, cracked 3 passwords, intercepted sensitive data from 5 clients. Findings revealed: 25% of users had weak passwords, 40% transmitted sensitive data over HTTP, 100% connected to fake network without verification. Recommendations: implement 802.1X enterprise authentication, mandatory VPN for sensitive work, security awareness training emphasizing risks of public WiFi, HTTPS-only policy for all applications.",
