Configure your browser to use that proxy, or use curl with `-x http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Turn on 'Intercept is on' in the Proxy tab. All HTTP/HTTPS requests will pause for you to inspect and modify before forwarding."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I intercepted a request in Burp. How do I test for IDOR?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Send the request to Repeater (Ctrl+R). Look for parameters like `id=123` or `userId=456`. Change the value to test other IDs like `id=1` or `id=100`. If you get different user data back without authorization errors, it's an IDOR vulnerability."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I automate testing multiple values in Burp?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use Burp Intruder. Send request to Intruder (Ctrl+I), highlight the value to test and click 'Add §'. Choose attack type (Sniper for single param, Cluster bomb for combinations). Load payloads from list or generate numbers 1-1000. Click 'Start attack' and look for different response sizes or status codes."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between Burp Spider and Scanner?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spider crawls the site to discover URLs and build a site map. It follows links but doesn't test for vulnerabilities. Scanner actively tests discovered URLs for security issues like SQLi, XSS, etc. Run Spider first to find all pages, then Scanner to test them for vulnerabilities."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I use OWASP ZAP from command line?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Start ZAP in daemon mode: `zap.sh -daemon -port 8090`. Then use API commands: `curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/JSON/spider/action/scan/?url=http://target.com'` to spider, and `curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/JSON/ascan/action/scan/?url=http://target.com'` to scan for vulnerabilities. Get results with `/JSON/core/view/alerts/`."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is mitmproxy and when should I use it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mitmproxy is a command-line HTTP proxy like Burp but scriptable with Python. Use it when you need automated request modification or want to save traffic to files. Run `mitmproxy -p 8888` for console UI, `mitmweb -p 8888` for web UI, or `mitmdump -p 8888 -w traffic.dump` to save all traffic."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test for HTTP method tampering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use curl to test different methods: `curl -X DELETE http://api.com/user/123`. Also test GET endpoints with POST/PUT/DELETE. In Burp Repeater, just change the method in the request. If DELETE works on a read endpoint or modifies data, it's a vulnerability."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What headers should I inject to test for access control bypass?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try these: `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` (IP whitelist bypass), `X-Original-URL: /admin` (URL rewriting bypass), `X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1`, `X-Forwarded-Host: localhost`, `Host: localhost`. Add them with curl `-H` flag or in Burp Repeater and see if you get unauthorized access."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test for Host header injection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Change the Host header to your domain: `curl -H 'Host: evil.com' http://target.com/password-reset`. Check if the response contains links or redirects to evil.com. This works for password reset poisoning - reset emails will contain links to your domain with the victim's token."}]}

{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's CORS and how do I test for misconfiguration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CORS controls which domains can make cross-origin requests. Test with: `curl -H 'Origin: http://evil.com' http://api.com/users -v`. Check response headers: if you see `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, any site can make authenticated requests - major vulnerability."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test for path traversal?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try `../ ` sequences in file parameters: `curl 'http://site.com/download?file=../../../../etc/passwd'`.

{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I automate testing sequential IDs for IDOR?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use a bash loop: `for i in {1..100}; do curl -s \"http://api.com/user?id=$i\" | jq -r '.email'; done`. This tests IDs 1-100 and extracts emails. If you see different user emails, it's an IDOR vulnerability. Pipe through `grep -v null` to filter empty responses."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attack types does Burp Intruder have?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sniper: One payload position, iterates through one list. Battering ram: Multiple positions with same payload. Pitchfork: Multiple positions with parallel lists (pairs credentials). Cluster bomb: Tests all combinations of multiple lists. Use Cluster bomb for username:password combos, Pitchfork for credential stuffing with known pairs."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I extract values from Burp Intruder responses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use Grep - Extract. In Intruder options, add a pattern like `Set-Cookie: session=([^;]+)` to extract session tokens. Or `\"token\":\"([^\"]+)\"` for JSON. Results appear as a column in the attack results table showing extracted values for each payload."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test User-Agent filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Test with different User-Agents: `curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0' http://site.com` (browser), `curl -A 'sqlmap/1.0' http://site.com` (security tool), `curl -A '<script>alert(1)</script>' http://site.com` (XSS). Compare status codes. If security tools get 403 but XSS payloads get 200, the WAF blocks tools but not actual attacks."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I bypass SSL certificate errors with curl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `-k` or `--insecure` flag: `curl -k https://site.com`. This disables certificate verification. Useful for testing self-signed certs or intercepting with proxies like Burp. Never use in production or against sites you don't control - it disables important security."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test for parameter pollution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Send duplicate parameters: `curl 'http://api.com/update?role=user&role=admin'`. Different frameworks handle this differently - some use first value, some last, some both. In Burp Repeater, add the same parameter twice. If role=admin overwrites role=user, you might escalate privileges."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I save HTTP metrics with curl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `-w` flag with format string: `curl -w 'Status: %{http_code}\\nTime: %{time_total}s\\nSize: %{size_download}\\n' http://site.com -o /dev/null -s`. This shows status, response time, and size without the body. Useful for timing attacks or detecting behavior differences."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test HTTP Basic Authentication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Encode credentials in base64: `echo -n 'admin:password' | base64` gives `YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=`. Then: `curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=' http://site.com`. Or use curl's built-in: `curl -u admin:password http://site.com`. Test weak passwords and brute force."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I write a mitmproxy script to modify requests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Create Python file: `def request(flow): flow.request.headers['X-Admin'] = 'true'`.

{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between mitmproxy, mitmweb, and mitmdump?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mitmproxy: Console UI with keyboard shortcuts, interactive flow inspection. Mitmweb: Browser-based UI at localhost:8081, easier for beginners. Mitmdump: No UI, just logs traffic to terminal or file, good for automation and scripting. All three use the same core proxy on port 8888."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I limit curl request rate to avoid detection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `--limit-rate`: `curl --limit-rate 100K http://site.com/file.zip`. This limits to 100 KB/s. For requests in a loop, add sleep: `for i in {1..100}; do curl http://site.com/page?id=$i; sleep 1; done`. The sleep 1 adds 1 second delay between requests to avoid rate limiting."}]}
